            <br><h3><strong> world </strong></h3><br>
                 <p>A story or narrative is a connected series of events told through words (written or spoken), imagery (still and moving), <br>
                 body language, performance, music, or any other form of communication. <br>
                 ... There are stories about all things and all times; past, present and future.</p>
            <br><h4><strong> future </strong></h4><br>
                 <p>IT was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, <br>
                     and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful. The stork walking about on his long red legs <br>
                      chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother. The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, <br>
                       in the midst of which were deep pools. It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country. In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high,<br>
                       that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest,<br>
                     watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time</p>
